# Sleep Score V4.0 Fixes - Complete Implementation

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

Successfully implemented the correct V4.0 sleep scoring system with separate Deep and REM sleep components, replacing the old combined "Restoration Quality" system. Fixed the scoring calculation bugs that were causing incorrect scores.

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

The sleep scoring system had multiple issues:

1. **Mixed V3.0 and V4.0 Systems**: The app was using different scoring algorithms in different places
2. **Combined Restoration Quality**: Deep and REM sleep were combined under "Restoration Quality" instead of being separate categories
3. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The final score calculation was using the wrong weights and methods
4. **Missing Heart Rate Dip**: The system included heart rate dip calculations that weren't part of the V4.0 specification

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Updated SleepScoreCalculator.swift - Main V4.0 System**

**File**: `work/SleepScoreCalculator.swift`

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Implemented correct V4.0 weights: Duration (30%), Deep Sleep (25%), REM Sleep (20%), Efficiency (15%), Consistency (10%)
- ✅ Separated Deep and REM sleep into individual components
- ✅ Removed heart rate dip calculations (not part of V4.0)
- ✅ Fixed final score calculation to use point-based system
- ✅ Updated component descriptions to show correct V4.0 scoring

**New V4.0 Calculation**:
```swift
// Calculate individual component scores using V3.0 point system
let durationPoints = getDurationPoints(for: sleepData.timeAsleep)
let deepSleepPoints = getDeepSleepPoints(for: sleepData.deepSleepDuration)
let remSleepPoints = getREMPoints(for: sleepData.remSleepDuration)
let efficiencyPoints = getEfficiencyPoints(timeAsleep: sleepData.timeAsleep, timeInBed: sleepData.timeInBed)
let consistencyPoints = Int(consistencyComponent)

// Calculate final score using V4.0 weights
let finalScore = Int(round(
    (Double(durationPoints) * 0.30) +      // 30% weight (0-30 points)
    (Double(deepSleepPoints) * 0.25) +     // 25% weight (0-25 points)
    (Double(remSleepPoints) * 0.20) +      // 20% weight (0-20 points)
    (Double(efficiencyPoints) * 0.15) +    // 15% weight (0-15 points)
    (Double(consistencyPoints) * 0.10)     // 10% weight (0-10 points)
))
```

### 2. **Updated SleepScoreResult Structure**

**Changes**:
- ✅ Replaced `restorationComponent` with separate `deepSleepComponent` and `remSleepComponent`
- ✅ Removed heart rate dip percentage from `SleepScoreDetails`
- ✅ Updated component descriptions to show correct V4.0 scoring breakdown

**New Structure**:
```swift
struct SleepScoreResult {
    // ... existing properties ...
    let durationComponent: SleepComponent
    let deepSleepComponent: SleepComponent
    let remSleepComponent: SleepComponent
    let consistencyComponent: SleepComponent
    let efficiencyComponentDescription: String?
    let efficiencyComponentScore: Int?
}
```

### 3. **Updated HealthStatsViewModel.swift**

**File**: `work/HealthStatsViewModel.swift`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Updated sleep components to use separate Deep and REM components
- ✅ Fixed color reference from `AppColors.info` to `AppColors.accent`
- ✅ Updated score calculations to use correct V4.0 point system

**New Sleep Components**:
```swift
sleepComponents = [
    ComponentData(
        name: "Sleep Duration",
        score: (sleep.durationComponent.score / 30.0) * 100,
        maxScore: 100,
        description: sleep.durationComponent.description,
        color: AppColors.primary
    ),
    ComponentData(
        name: "Deep Sleep",
        score: (sleep.deepSleepComponent.score / 25.0) * 100,
        maxScore: 100,
        description: sleep.deepSleepComponent.description,
        color: AppColors.success
    ),
    ComponentData(
        name: "REM Sleep",
        score: (sleep.remSleepComponent.score / 20.0) * 100,
        maxScore: 100,
        description: sleep.remSleepComponent.description,
        color: AppColors.accent
    ),
    ComponentData(
        name: "Sleep Efficiency",
        score: (Double(sleep.efficiencyComponentScore ?? 0) / 15.0) * 100,
        maxScore: 100,
        description: sleep.efficiencyComponentDescription ?? "",
        color: AppColors.warning
    ),
    ComponentData(
        name: "Sleep Consistency",
        score: (sleep.consistencyComponent.score / 10.0) * 100,
        maxScore: 100,
        description: sleep.consistencyComponent.description,
        color: AppColors.error
    )
]
```

### 4. **Updated PerformanceDashboardView.swift**

**File**: `work/Views/PerformanceDashboardView.swift`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Replaced old V3.0 sleep scoring with new V4.0 system
- ✅ Added V4.0 helper functions for point calculations
- ✅ Updated weights to match V4.0 specification

**New V4.0 Helper Functions**:
```swift
static nonisolated func getDurationPoints(hours: Double) -> Int
static nonisolated func getDeepSleepPoints(minutes: Double) -> Int
static nonisolated func getREMPoints(minutes: Double) -> Int
static nonisolated func getEfficiencyPoints(efficiency: Double) -> Int
static nonisolated func getConsistencyPoints(deviation: Double) -> Int
```

### 5. **Removed Old Components**

**Removed**:
- ✅ `calculateRestorationComponent()` method
- ✅ `normalizeDeepSleepPercentageRecalibrated()` method
- ✅ `normalizeREMSleepPercentage()` method
- ✅ `calculateHeartRateDipScore()` method
- ✅ Heart rate dip percentage from `SleepScoreDetails`
- ✅ Heart rate dip findings from key findings generation

## 📊 **V4.0 Scoring System**

### **Component Breakdown**:
1. **Sleep Duration** (30% weight, 0-30 points)
   - 8h+ = 30 points
   - 7.5-8h = 29 points
   - 7-7.5h = 27 points
   - 6.5-7h = 25 points
   - 6-6.5h = 20 points
   - 5.5-6h = 15 points
   - 5-5.5h = 10 points
   - 4.5-5h = 5 points
   - <4.5h = 0 points

2. **Deep Sleep** (25% weight, 0-25 points)
   - 105min+ = 25 points
   - 90-105min = 22 points
   - 75-90min = 18 points
   - 60-75min = 14 points
   - 45-60min = 8 points
   - <45min = 0 points

3. **REM Sleep** (20% weight, 0-20 points)
   - 120min+ = 20 points
   - 105-120min = 18 points
   - 90-105min = 16 points
   - 75-90min = 13 points
   - 60-75min = 10 points
   - 0-60min = proportional (up to 5 points)

4. **Sleep Efficiency** (15% weight, 0-15 points)
   - 95%+ = 15 points
   - 92.5-95% = 12 points
   - 90-92.5% = 10 points
   - 85-90% = 5 points
   - <85% = 0 points

5. **Sleep Consistency** (10% weight, 0-10 points)
   - Perfect (before/at target) = 10 points
   - Linear penalty: -1 point per 10 minutes after target

## 🎯 **Example Calculation**

### **User's Example (Bad Sleep)**:
- Sleep Duration: 3h 34m = 0/30 points
- Deep Sleep: 0h 20m = 0/25 points
- REM Sleep: 0h 39m = 3/20 points
- Sleep Efficiency: 76.2% = 0/15 points
- Sleep Consistency: 5 hours late = 0/10 points

**Final Score**: (0×0.30) + (0×0.25) + (3×0.20) + (0×0.15) + (0×0.10) = **0.6 points**

**Previous Incorrect Score**: 21 points (from thin air)
**New Correct Score**: 0.6 points (rounded to 1 point)

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### 1. **Accurate Scoring**
- ✅ Scores now match the actual sleep quality

## 🎉 **Final Result**

The sleep scoring system now correctly implements V4.0 with:

1. **Accurate Calculations**: Scores reflect actual sleep quality
