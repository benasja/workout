# Overnight Recovery Score Implementation - Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented a proper Recovery Score system that captures overnight physiological data as a static snapshot, following industry best practices used by companies like Whoop and Oura.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

**Previous Issue**: Your recovery score was changing throughout the day because it was fetching data continuously, creating a "Live Status" monitor instead of a true recovery assessment.

**Solution Implemented**: A proper Recovery Score that:
- âœ… Uses only overnight data from the sleep session
- âœ… Calculates once in the morning and remains static throughout the day
- âœ… Provides a stable baseline for daily planning decisions

## ðŸ”§ Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced HealthKitManager (`work/HealthKitManager.swift`)
- âœ… Added `fetchMainSleepSession()` to detect the main sleep session for a wake date
- âœ… Added interval-based data fetching methods:
  - `fetchHRVForInterval()` - HRV during sleep only
  - `fetchRHRForInterval()` - Lowest RHR during sleep (best recovery state)
  - `fetchWalkingHeartRateForInterval()` - Stress metrics during sleep
  - `fetchRespiratoryRateForInterval()` - Respiratory rate during sleep
  - `fetchOxygenSaturationForInterval()` - Oxygen saturation during sleep
- âœ… Added sleep session grouping and analysis logic

### 2. Persistent Storage System (`work/Models/ScoreHistory.swift`)
- âœ… Created new `RecoveryScore` model with comprehensive data storage
- âœ… Stores all component scores, raw metrics, and baseline values
- âœ… Includes sleep session timing and detailed descriptions
- âœ… Implemented `ScoreHistoryStore` with recovery score persistence methods

### 3. Completely Rewritten RecoveryScoreCalculator (`work/RecoveryScoreCalculator.swift`)
- âœ… **Sleep Session Detection**: Finds the main sleep session for the wake date
- âœ… **Overnight Data Only**: Fetches HRV, RHR, and stress metrics only during sleep
- âœ… **Persistent Storage**: Stores calculated scores permanently
- âœ… **Static Results**: Once calculated, scores don't change throughout the day
- âœ… **Smart Caching**: Checks for stored scores before calculating new ones

### 4. Updated ViewModels
- âœ… Modified `HealthStatsViewModel` to use the new system
- âœ… Updated `PerformanceDashboardView` to display static recovery scores
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## ðŸ”„ New Data Flow

### Morning Calculation (First App Launch):
1. App detects no stored recovery score for today
2. Finds last night's sleep session (e.g., 11 PM - 6 AM)
3. Fetches HRV, RHR, and stress metrics during that window only
4. Calculates recovery score using overnight data
5. Stores result permanently

### Throughout the Day:
1. App requests recovery score for today
2. Finds stored score from morning calculation
3. Returns static score without recalculation

## ðŸ“Š Benefits Achieved

### 1. True Recovery Assessment
- âœ… Measures actual overnight recovery, not daily stress
- âœ… Uses lowest RHR during sleep (best recovery state)
- âœ… Analyzes HRV during sleep (autonomic recovery)

### 2. Stable Planning Tool
- âœ… Score remains constant throughout the day
- âœ… Provides reliable baseline for training decisions
- âœ… Aligns with industry best practices

### 3. Improved Accuracy
- âœ… Eliminates confounding factors from daily activities
- âœ… Focuses on physiological recovery markers
- âœ… Uses personal baselines for stress assessment

## ðŸ§ª Technical Implementation

### Sleep Session Detection
```swift
// Fetch sleep samples that end between previous day noon and this day noon
let startOfWindow = calendar.date(byAdding: .hour, value: 12, to: calendar.startOfDay(for: calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: -1, to: wakeDate)!))!
let endOfWindow = calendar.date(byAdding: .hour, value: 12, to: calendar.startOfDay(for: wakeDate))!
```

### Overnight Data Fetching
```swift
// Fetch HRV during sleep session only
HealthKitManager.shared.fetchHRVForInterval(sleepSession) { value in
    hrv = value
}

// Fetch RHR during sleep session only (lowest value during sleep)
HealthKitManager.shared.fetchRHRForInterval(sleepSession) { value in
    rhr = value
}
```

### Persistent Storage
```swift
// Store the result permanently so it doesn't change throughout the day
let recoveryScore = RecoveryScore(...)
scoreStore.saveRecoveryScore(recoveryScore)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

The new system is transparent to existing code:

```swift
// This will return a stored score if it exists, or calculate a new one using overnight data
let recoveryResult = try await RecoveryScoreCalculator.shared.calculateRecoveryScore(for: Date())

print("Recovery Score: \(recoveryResult.finalScore)")
print("Directive: \(recoveryResult.directive)")
print("Sleep Session: \(recoveryResult.sleepSessionStart) to \(recoveryResult.sleepSessionEnd)")
```

## ðŸ”’ Data Integrity

- âœ… **Permanent Storage**: Recovery scores are stored permanently and don't expire
- âœ… **Comprehensive Data**: All raw metrics, baselines, and component scores are preserved
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if overnight data is unavailable
- âœ… **Validation**: Proper data validation and integrity checks

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Your recovery score will now:
1. **Calculate once per day** using overnight data only
2. **Remain static** throughout the day regardless of activities
3. **Provide accurate recovery assessment** based on actual physiological recovery
4. **Enable better daily planning** with a stable baseline

The implementation follows the exact specifications you requested and aligns with industry best practices. Your recovery score is now a true measure of overnight recovery rather than a live stress monitor.
