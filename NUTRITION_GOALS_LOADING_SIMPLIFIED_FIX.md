# Nutrition Goals Loading Simplified Fix

## Problem
The nutrition tab was showing a loading spinner indefinitely and not updating, but when navigating to a previous day and back, it would instantly appear with the correct data.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by overcomplicating the loading state management:
1. **Complex Loading State**: Added `hasLoadedInitialData` flag that was causing confusion
2. **Error Handling Loop**: The error handler might have been causing infinite retries
3. **Race Condition**: The loading state wasn't properly managed

## Solution

### Simplified Approach
**Removed the complex `hasLoadedInitialData` tracking** and went back to the original simple loading state check.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Complex Loading State**:
   - Removed `@Published var hasLoadedInitialData: Bool = false`
   - Reverted to simple `isLoadingInitialData` check

2. **Fixed Error Handling**:
   - Added error logging to `loadInitialData()` method
   - Ensured error handler doesn't cause infinite loops

3. **Simplified View Logic**:
   - Reverted to: `if viewModel.isLoadingInitialData`
   - Removed the complex `|| !viewModel.hasLoadedInitialData` condition

### Code Changes

**FuelLogViewModel.swift**:
```swift
// Removed: @Published var hasLoadedInitialData: Bool = false
// Removed: hasLoadedInitialData = true logic
// Added: Error logging in loadInitialData()
```

**FuelLogDashboardView.swift**:
```swift
// Before (complex):
if viewModel.isLoadingInitialData || !viewModel.hasLoadedInitialData {
    LoadingView(message: "Loading nutrition data...")
}

// After (simple):
if viewModel.isLoadingInitialData {
    LoadingView(message: "Loading nutrition data...")
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Loading state works correctly
- ✅ No more infinite loading spinner
- ✅ Navigation between days works properly
- ✅ Nutrition goals are properly detected when they exist

## Key Insight
Sometimes the simplest solution is the best. The original `isLoadingInitialData` approach was sufficient, and adding complexity with additional loading state flags created more problems than it solved.

## Testing
The fix ensures:
1. Loading state is shown during initial data fetch
2. Loading state is properly cleared when data loading completes
3. Navigation between days works correctly
4. No infinite loading loops
