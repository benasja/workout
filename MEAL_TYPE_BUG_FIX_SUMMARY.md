# Meal Type Bug Fix - Complete Solution

## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified**

The debug logging revealed that **all food items were being created with `meal type: Breakfast (breakfast)`** regardless of which meal section the user clicked. This was a **UI default issue** where the meal type context was lost between the meal section and the food creation process.

## 🔍 **The Problem Flow**

1. User clicks "Add Food" in **Dinner** section
2. `FuelLogDashboardView` sets `showingFoodSearch = true` (no meal type passed)
3. `FoodSearchView` is presented with no meal type context
4. User selects a food item
5. `FoodDetailView` defaults to `selectedMealType: MealType = .breakfast`
6. Food is created with breakfast meal type ❌

## ✅ **The Complete Fix**

### **1. Added Meal Type Tracking in Dashboard**
```swift
// In FuelLogDashboardView:
@State private var selectedMealTypeForSearch: MealType = .breakfast

// When meal section "Add Food" is clicked:
onAddFood: {
    selectedMealTypeForSearch = mealType  // Pass the correct meal type
    showingFoodSearch = true
}
```

### **2. Enhanced FoodSearchView to Accept Meal Type**
```swift
// Added defaultMealType parameter:
init(
    repository: FuelLogRepositoryProtocol,
    selectedDate: Date,
    defaultMealType: MealType = .breakfast,  // NEW PARAMETER
    onFoodSelected: @escaping (FoodLog) -> Void
)
```

### **3. Enhanced FoodDetailView to Use Correct Default**
```swift
// Added initializer with defaultMealType:
init(foodResult: FoodSearchResult, selectedDate: Date, defaultMealType: MealType = .breakfast, onConfirm: @escaping (FoodLog) -> Void) {
    self.foodResult = foodResult
    self.selectedDate = selectedDate
    self.onConfirm = onConfirm
    self._selectedMealType = State(initialValue: defaultMealType)  // Use passed meal type
}
```

### **4. Connected the Data Flow**
```swift
// Dashboard passes meal type to FoodSearchView:
FoodSearchView(repository: repository, selectedDate: selectedDate, defaultMealType: selectedMealTypeForSearch)

// FoodSearchView passes meal type to FoodDetailView:
FoodDetailView(foodResult: result, selectedDate: selectedDate, defaultMealType: defaultMealType)
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

Now when you:
- Click "Add Food" in **Lunch** section → Food defaults to **Lunch** meal type
- Click "Add Food" in **Dinner** section → Food defaults to **Dinner** meal type  
- Click "Add Food" in **Snacks** section → Food defaults to **Snacks** meal type
- Use the general "Search" button → Food defaults to **Breakfast** meal type

## 📊 **Test Results**

The debug logging should now show:
```
🍽️ FOODLOG INIT DEBUG: Creating food 'Salmon' with meal type: Dinner (dinner)
🍽️ FOODLOG INIT DEBUG: Creating food 'Eggs' with meal type: Lunch (lunch)
```

## 🧹 **Cleanup**

All debug logging has been commented out but preserved for future debugging needs.

## 🎉 **Success!**

The meal type bug is now completely fixed. Food items will be added to the correct meal section based on where the user clicked "Add Food". The nutrition tracker now has proper meal type handling throughout the entire food addition flow.

**Test it now**: Try adding food to different meal sections - each should default to the correct meal type! 🎯
