## üìä **Health Analytics Engine**

### ‚ù§Ô∏è **Recovery Score Algorithm**
Scientifically-backed multi-factor scoring system for optimal training readiness.

#### **Component Breakdown**
- **HRV Component (50% weight)**: Heart Rate Variability analysis
  - Uses overnight SDNN measurements from Apple Health
  - Compares to personal 60-day baseline
  - Logarithmic scaling for accurate representation
  
- **RHR Component (25% weight)**: Resting Heart Rate trends
  - Daily RHR compared to personal baseline
  - Inverse relationship (lower RHR = better recovery)
  - Exponential scaling for sensitivity
  
- **Sleep Component (15% weight)**: Sleep quality integration
  - Uses comprehensive sleep score from Sleep Analysis
  - Factors in duration, efficiency, and sleep stages
  - Weighted contribution to overall recovery
  
- **Stress Component (10% weight)**: Physiological stress indicators
  - Walking Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Oxygen Saturation
  - Deviation analysis from personal baselines
  - Multi-metric stress assessment

#### **Scoring Interpretation**
- **85-100**: Primed for peak performance - high-intensity training recommended
- **70-84**: Good recovery state - moderate to high-intensity appropriate
- **55-69**: Moderate recovery - consider lighter training or active recovery
- **Below 55**: Focus on recovery - prioritize rest and stress management

### üò¥ **Sleep Score Algorithm**
Comprehensive sleep quality assessment using multiple physiological markers.

#### **Component Analysis**
- **Restoration Component (45% weight)**:
  - Deep Sleep Score (40%): Optimal range 13-23% of total sleep
  - REM Sleep Score (40%): Optimal range 20-25% of total sleep
  - Heart Rate Dip Score (20%): Sleeping HR vs. daily RHR comparison

- **Efficiency Component (30% weight)**:
  - Sleep Efficiency: Time asleep / Time in bed ratio
  - Optimal efficiency: 85%+ for healthy adults
  - Accounts for time to fall asleep and wake periods

- **Consistency Component (25% weight)**:
  - Bedtime consistency compared to personal baseline
  - Wake time consistency analysis
  - Circadian rhythm alignment assessment

#### **Duration Multiplier (The Gatekeeper)**
- **Below 6 hours**: 65% multiplier (harsh penalty)
- **6-7 hours**: Linear scaling from 65% to 90%
- **7-9 hours**: 100% multiplier (optimal range)
- **Above 9 hours**: Gradual penalty for potential oversleeping

### üìà **Dynamic Baseline Engine**
Personalized baseline calculation system using your historical Apple Health data.

#### **Baseline Calculation**
- **60-day HRV Average**: Long-term HRV baseline for recovery scoring
- **14-day HRV Average**: Short-term trend analysis
- **60-day RHR Average**: Resting heart rate baseline
- **14-day Sleep Patterns**: Bedtime and wake time consistency
- **Stress Metric Baselines**: Walking HR, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation

#### **Adaptive Learning**
- **Continuous Updates**: Baselines recalculate as new data becomes available
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Accounts for natural variations in health metrics
- **Personalization**: Unique baselines for each individual user
- **Data Quality**: Filters out anomalous readings for accurate baselines
