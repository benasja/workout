# Workout Navigation Fix

## Issue
The workout quick action button in PerformanceView was trying to navigate to `WorkoutView()` without the required `workout` parameter, causing a compilation error:
```
Missing argument for parameter 'workout' in call
```

## Root Cause
- `WorkoutView` requires a `WorkoutSession` parameter: `WorkoutView(workout: WorkoutSession)`
- The quick action was trying to call `WorkoutView()` without any parameters
- This was incorrect because `WorkoutView` is for active workout sessions, not for starting new workouts

## Solution
Changed the navigation destination from `WorkoutView()` to `ActiveWorkoutView()`:

**Before:**
```swift
NavigationLink(destination: WorkoutView()) {
    QuickActionCard(
        title: "Workout",
        icon: "dumbbell.fill",
        color: .orange
    )
}
```

**After:**
```swift
NavigationLink(destination: ActiveWorkoutView()) {
    QuickActionCard(
        title: "Workout",
        icon: "dumbbell.fill",
        color: .orange
    )
}
```

## Why ActiveWorkoutView is Correct
`ActiveWorkoutView` is the proper entry point for workouts because it:
- Shows "Ready to Train?" when no workout is active
- Provides options to "Start Quick Workout" or "Choose from Programs"
- Handles the workout initiation flow
- Transitions to `WorkoutView` only after a workout session is created

## User Experience
- **Before**: Compilation error, button didn't work
- **After**: Tapping "Workout" opens the "Ready to Train?" screen
- **Flow**: Today Tab â†’ Workout Button â†’ "Ready to Train?" â†’ Start Workout

## Files Modified
- `work/Views/PerformanceView.swift`

## Validation Results
- âœ… Compilation error resolved
- âœ… Proper navigation flow implemented
- âœ… All syntax validation checks pass

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **Workout navigation fixed successfully**
The workout quick action now properly opens the "Ready to Train?" view as requested.
