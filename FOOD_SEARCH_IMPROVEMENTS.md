# Food Search and Quick Add Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the food search functionality and renamed "Quick Add" to better reflect its purpose as a meal creation tool.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Food Search Shows All Foods by Default
**Files Modified**: 
- `work/Views/FoodSearchView.swift`
- `work/ViewModels/FoodSearchViewModel.swift`

**Changes**:
- Removed empty search state that showed "Search for Foods" message
- Modified search logic to display all available foods when search field is empty
- Added `loadAllAvailableFoods()` method to load both custom foods and basic database foods
- Foods are now visible immediately when opening the search view

**Before**: Empty search showed placeholder message
**After**: All available foods (custom + basic database) shown by default

### 2. ‚úÖ Food Sorting by Usage Priority
**Implementation**:
- Custom foods appear first (user-created foods have priority)
- Basic database foods appear second
- TODO: Future enhancement for actual usage tracking based on frequency

**Sorting Order**:
1. Custom Foods (user-created)
2. Basic Database Foods (30 built-in items)
3. API Results (when searching)

### 3. ‚úÖ Renamed "Quick Add" to "Add New Meal"
**Files Modified**:
- `work/Views/FuelLogDashboardView.swift`
- `work/Views/QuickAddView.swift`

**Changes**:
- Button text: "Quick Add" ‚Üí "Add New Meal"
- Navigation title: "Quick Add" ‚Üí "Add New Meal"
- Header text: "Quick Add Macros" ‚Üí "Add New Meal"
- Description: "Enter raw macronutrient values for quick logging" ‚Üí "Create a custom meal with your own macronutrient values"
- Accessibility label: "Quick add macros" ‚Üí "Add new meal"

## User Experience Improvements

### Food Search Flow
**Before**:
1. Open food search ‚Üí See empty state
2. Type to search ‚Üí See results
3. Limited to search-based discovery

**After**:
1. Open food search ‚Üí See all available foods immediately
2. Browse or search ‚Üí All foods visible by default
3. Better food discovery and selection

### Food Availability
- **30 Built-in Foods**: Always available offline
- **Custom Foods**: User-created foods prioritized
- **Search Results**: API results when searching with internet

### Meal Creation
**Before**: "Quick Add" suggested rapid macro entry
**After**: "Add New Meal" suggests thoughtful meal creation

## Technical Implementation

### FoodSearchViewModel Changes
```swift
// New method to load all available foods
private func loadAllAvailableFoods() async {
    // Combine custom foods + basic database foods
    // Sort by priority (custom first, then basic)
    searchResults = customFoodResults + basicFoodResults
}

// Modified search text behavior
if searchText.isEmpty {
    await loadAllAvailableFoods() // Show all foods
} else {
    await performSearch() // Search specific foods
}
```

### FoodSearchView Changes
```swift
// Simplified content logic
if viewModel.isSearching {
    loadingState
} else if viewModel.searchResults.isEmpty && !viewModel.searchText.isEmpty {
    noResultsState
} else {
    searchResultsList // Always show results (all foods or search results)
}
```
