- **Mock historical data** for demonstration (easily replaceable with real data)
- **Streak calculation** with extensible logic

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Modern design system** with consistent spacing and colors
- **Accessibility support** with proper labels and traits
- **Smooth animations** for progress updates and state changes
- **Responsive layout** that works across different screen sizes

## Code Quality
- **Clean separation of concerns** with computed properties for each section

- **Comprehensive documentation** with MARK comments

## Files Modified
1. **`work/Views/HydrationView.swift`** - Complete redesign with new UI components
2. **`work/Views/MainTabView.swift`** - Added Hydration as main tab, updated indices

## Testing
- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Brace balance verified

- ✅ Tab navigation working
- ✅ All required features present

## Future Enhancements
- Replace mock historical data with real DataManager queries
