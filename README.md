## 🎯 **Key Algorithms Explained**

### 🔄 **Recovery Score Formula**
```swift
Recovery Score = (HRV_Component × 0.50) + 
                (RHR_Component × 0.25) + 
                (Sleep_Component × 0.15) + 
                (Stress_Component × 0.10)

// Where each component is scored 0-100 based on personal baselines
```

### 😴 **Sleep Score Calculation**
```swift
Sleep Score = Component_Score × Duration_Multiplier

Component_Score = (Restoration × 0.45) + 
                 (Efficiency × 0.30) + 
                 (Consistency × 0.25)

Duration_Multiplier = f(hours_slept) // Gatekeeper function
```

### 📈 **Dynamic Baseline Engine**
```swift
// Personal baselines calculated from historical data
HRV_Baseline = rolling_average(hrv_data, 60_days)
RHR_Baseline = rolling_average(rhr_data, 60_days)
Sleep_Baseline = pattern_analysis(sleep_data, 14_days)
```
