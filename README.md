```swift
// Comprehensive sleep assessment:
// - Sleep duration vs. recommended ranges
// - Sleep efficiency
// - Deep sleep percentage
// - REM sleep patterns
// - Sleep consistency
```

#### Correlation Analysis
```swift
// Statistical correlation engine:
// - T-test for significance
// - Effect size calculation
// - Multi-factor regression
// - Pattern recognition
// - Confidence intervals
```
