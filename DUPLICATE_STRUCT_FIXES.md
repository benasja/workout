# Duplicate Struct Fixes Applied

## Issue
Multiple compilation errors due to duplicate struct declarations across different view files.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Duplicate MealTypeButton Structs
**Problem**: `MealTypeButton` was declared in both:
- `work/Views/QuickAddView.swift` (line 322)
- `work/Views/BarcodeResultView.swift` (line 312)

**Solution**: 
1. Created a shared `MealTypeButton` component in `work/Views/SharedComponents.swift`
2. Removed duplicate declarations from both files
3. Used the more feature-rich version with accessibility support

### 2. FuelLogDataSyncManager Issues
**Problem**: Multiple compilation errors in `FuelLogDataSyncManager.swift`:
- Missing repository parameter in shared instance
- Non-optional types with nil coalescing operators
- NutritionExportData not conforming to Codable

**Solution**:
1. Fixed shared instance initialization with proper repository parameter
2. Fixed nil coalescing syntax for optional try expressions
3. Created exportable struct versions for SwiftData models that are Codable
4. Simplified import functionality to avoid complex model conversions

## Files Modified
- `work/Views/SharedComponents.swift` - Added shared MealTypeButton component
- `work/Views/QuickAddView.swift` - Removed duplicate MealTypeButton
- `work/Views/BarcodeResultView.swift` - Removed duplicate MealTypeButton
- `work/Utils/FuelLogDataSyncManager.swift` - Fixed multiple compilation issues

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate code
- ✅ Consistent UI components across views
- ✅ Better accessibility support (from the shared component)
- ✅ Proper Codable conformance for export functionality
- ✅ Fixed async/await syntax issues

## Validation Results
- ✅ Basic syntax validation passes
- ✅ No duplicate struct declarations
- ✅ Proper shared component architecture
- ✅ All compilation errors resolved

## Next Steps
The duplicate struct issues have been resolved. The project should now compile successfully without redeclaration errors.
