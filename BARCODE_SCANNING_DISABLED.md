- Changed button appearance to gray/disabled state
- Added `.disabled(true)` modifier
- Updated accessibility labels to indicate the feature is disabled

## User Experience Impact

### Before:
- Users could tap "Scan" button to open camera
- Barcode scanner would attempt to scan product barcodes
- Results would be processed and displayed

### After:
- "Scan" button is visually disabled (grayed out)
- Button is non-functional (`.disabled(true)`)
- Accessibility label indicates feature is "temporarily disabled"
- No camera access or barcode processing occurs

## Future Considerations
When barcode scanning is fixed and ready to be re-enabled:

3. Restore original button styling and colors
4. Update accessibility labels back to functional state

## Files Modified
