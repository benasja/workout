# WorkoutView Compilation Fixes - Round 2

## Errors Fixed:

### 1. Line 616: Member 'tertiary' in 'Color?' produces result of type 'some ShapeStyle'
**Issue**: `.tertiary` is not a valid Color property in SwiftUI
**Fix**: Replaced with `Color.secondary.opacity(0.6)` for a proper tertiary-like color

### 2. Line 812: Initializer for conditional binding must have Optional type, not 'String'
**Issue**: `primaryMuscleGroup` is a non-optional `String` in the ExerciseDefinition model, but code was treating it as optional
**Fix**: 
- Removed unnecessary `if let` conditional binding
- Changed `compactMap` to `map` in categories computation
- Updated `iconForMuscleGroup` function to accept non-optional String parameter

### 3. Lines 880 & 898: Cannot pass array of type '[any PersistentModel.Type]' as variadic arguments
**Issue**: ModelContainer initializer expects variadic parameters, not an array
**Fix**: Changed from `ModelContainer(for: [Type1.self, Type2.self])` to `ModelContainer(for: Type1.self, Type2.self)`

## Code Quality Improvements:
- Simplified conditional logic by removing unnecessary optional handling
- Improved type safety by matching function signatures to actual data types
- Fixed SwiftData ModelContainer initialization syntax

## Result:
All compilation errors should now be resolved while maintaining full functionality:
- ✅ Smart Exercise Cards with historical context
- ✅ Intelligent auto-fill system 
- ✅ Clean set table with proper data display
- ✅ Enhanced exercise selection with category filtering
- ✅ Proper color handling throughout the UI
- ✅ Correct SwiftData model container setup

The WorkoutView should now compile successfully and provide the full interactive logbook experience!
