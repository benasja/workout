# Food Editing Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive food editing functionality for the Fuel Log app, including clickable food items, editable serving sizes with European comma formatting, and percentage-based nutrition information.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. Clickable Food Items
- **Location**: `FuelLogDashboardView.swift` - `FoodLogRowView`
- **Feature**: All food items in the nutrition view are now clickable for editing
- **Implementation**: 
  - Wrapped entire food row in a `Button` for tap-to-edit functionality
  - Removed restriction that only allowed quick add entries to be edited
  - Added visual feedback with background color to indicate clickable state

### 2. Editable Serving Sizes with European Formatting
- **Location**: `FoodDetailView.swift` - `FoodEditView`
- **Feature**: Text field for entering serving amounts with European comma decimal separator
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `TextField` with `.decimalPad` keyboard type
  - Automatic conversion between comma (,) and period (.) decimal separators
  - Real-time validation and formatting
  - Quick serving buttons (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x) for common adjustments
  - "Done" button in keyboard toolbar for easy dismissal

### 3. Percentage of Daily Intake Display
- **Location**: `FoodDetailView.swift` - `nutritionRow` function
- **Feature**: Shows what percentage of daily nutrition goals each food item represents
- **Implementation**:
  - Calculates percentage for calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat
  - Displays as "X% of daily intake" below each nutrition value
  - Only shows when nutrition goals are available
  - Uses actual nutrition goals from user settings

### 4. Fixed Oil Serving Sizes
- **Location**: `BasicFoodDatabase.swift`
- **Feature**: Corrected oil serving sizes from 10ml to 100ml
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated Olive Oil: 100ml = 884 calories (was 10ml = 884 calories)
  - Updated Coconut Oil: 100ml = 862 calories (was 10ml = 862 calories)
  - Now shows correct calorie density per 100ml

### 5. Smart Edit View Selection
- **Location**: `FuelLogDashboardView.swift` - sheet presentation
- **Feature**: Automatically chooses the appropriate edit view based on food type
- **Implementation**:
  - Quick add entries use `QuickEditView` (existing functionality)
  - Regular food items use new `FoodEditView` with serving size support
  - Determined by `foodLog.isQuickAdd` property

### 6. Enhanced Food Display
- **Location**: `FoodDetailView.swift` - `adjustedServingDescription`
- **Feature**: Improved serving size display for different food types
- **Implementation**:
  - Shows whole numbers for countable items (bananas, apples, eggs)
  - Shows actual weight for weight-based foods (100g, 100ml)
  - Handles pluralization correctly (1 banana vs 2 bananas)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### FoodEditView Structure
```swift
struct FoodEditView: View {
    let foodLog: FoodLog
    let nutritionGoals: NutritionGoals?
    let onUpdate: (FoodLog) -> Void
    
    @State private var servingMultiplier: Double
    @State private var servingText: String
    @State private var selectedMealType: MealType
    @FocusState private var isServingFieldFocused: Bool
}
```

### European Comma Formatting
```swift
.onChange(of: servingText) { _, newValue in
    // Convert European comma format to decimal
    let normalizedValue = newValue.replacingOccurrences(of: ",", with: ".")
    if let value = Double(normalizedValue), value > 0 {
        servingMultiplier = min(value, 99.0)
    }
}
```

### Percentage Calculation
```swift
private func calculatePercentage(for nutrient: String, value: Double, goals: NutritionGoals) -> Double {
    switch nutrient {
    case "Calories":
        return (value / goals.dailyCalories) * 100
    case "Protein":
        return (value / goals.dailyProtein) * 100
    // ... etc
    }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Improvements

1. **Intuitive Editing**: Tap any food item to edit its serving size and meal type
2. **European-Friendly**: Use comma as decimal separator (e.g., "2,5" for 2.5 servings)
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of daily nutrition progress
4. **Quick Actions**: Preset serving size buttons for common adjustments
5. **Smart Defaults**: Maintains original food information while allowing adjustments

## ðŸ“± Usage Examples

### Editing a Banana
1. Tap on "Banana" in the nutrition view
2. Enter "4" in the serving field (or "4," for European format)
3. See "4 bananas" displayed
4. View updated calories: 356 kcal (89 Ã— 4)
5. See percentage: "18% of daily intake" (if daily goal is 2000 calories)

### Editing Oil
1. Tap on "Olive Oil" in the nutrition view
2. Enter "0,5" for half serving
3. See "50ml" displayed
4. View updated calories: 442 kcal (884 Ã— 0.5)
5. See percentage: "22% of daily intake"

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

1. **User taps food item** â†’ `FoodLogRowView` triggers `onEdit`
2. **Edit view opens** â†’ `FoodEditView` or `QuickEditView` based on food type
3. **User adjusts serving** â†’ Real-time calculation of nutrition values
4. **User confirms** â†’ `onUpdate` callback updates the food log
5. **UI refreshes** â†’ Updated values displayed in nutrition view
