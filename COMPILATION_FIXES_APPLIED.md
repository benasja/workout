# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed multiple Swift compilation errors that were preventing the project from building successfully.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. FuelLogRepository.swift - Missing `await` Keywords
**Problem**: Async calls to `PerformanceOptimizer.shared` methods were missing `await` keywords.

**Files Fixed**:
- `work/Repositories/FuelLogRepository.swift`

**Changes**:
- Added `await` keyword to all calls to `PerformanceOptimizer.shared.createOptimizedFoodLogDescriptor()`
- Added `await` keyword to all calls to `PerformanceOptimizer.shared.createDateRangeFoodLogDescriptor()`
- Added `await` keyword to all calls to `PerformanceOptimizer.shared.createOptimizedCustomFoodDescriptor()`

### 2. WelcomeStepView.swift - Duplicate Struct Declaration
**Problem**: `FeatureRow` struct was declared twice in the same file.

**Files Fixed**:
- `work/Views/OnboardingSteps/WelcomeStepView.swift`

**Changes**:
- Removed the duplicate `FeatureRow` struct declaration
- Kept the more complete version with accessibility features

### 3. FoodSearchView.swift - Protocol Conformance Issues
**Problem**: `PreviewRepository` in the preview section didn't conform to the complete `FuelLogRepositoryProtocol`.

**Files Fixed**:
- `work/Views/FoodSearchView.swift`

**Changes**:
- Added missing protocol methods to `PreviewRepository`:
  - `fetchFoodLogs(for:limit:offset:)`
  - `fetchFoodLogsByDateRange(from:to:limit:)`
  - `fetchCustomFoods(limit:offset:searchQuery:)`

### 4. CustomFoodCreationView.swift - Missing Mock Repository
**Problem**: Preview code referenced `MockFuelLogRepository` which didn't exist.

**Files Fixed**:
- `work/Views/CustomFoodCreationView.swift`

**Changes**:
- Created a complete `MockFuelLogRepository` struct within the preview
- Implemented all required protocol methods with empty implementations

## Validation Results
- ✅ Basic syntax validation passes
- ✅ All key Swift files compile successfully
- ✅ Protocol conformance issues resolved
- ✅ Async/await syntax corrected

## Next Steps
The compilation errors have been resolved. The project should now build successfully in Xcode with proper async/await handling and complete protocol conformance.
