# Privacy Permissions Fix

## Issue
App crashed with error: "This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSCameraUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data."

## Root Cause
The app includes barcode scanning functionality that requires camera access, but the Info.plist file was missing the required privacy usage descriptions.

## Privacy Keys Added

### 1. NSCameraUsageDescription
**Purpose**: Required for barcode scanning functionality
**Description**: "This app uses the camera to scan barcodes on food products for quick nutrition logging."

### 2. NSHealthShareUsageDescription
**Purpose**: Required for reading HealthKit data
**Description**: "This app reads health data to provide personalized nutrition insights and track your fitness progress."

### 3. NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription
**Purpose**: Required for writing nutrition data to HealthKit
**Description**: "This app writes nutrition data to HealthKit to keep your health information synchronized across all your devices."
