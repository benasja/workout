# WorkoutView Compilation Fixes

## Errors Identified and Fixed:

### 1. Line 608: Generic parameter 'V' could not be inferred
**Issue**: Using `Group` with conditional content caused type inference issues
**Fix**: Replaced `Group` with `VStack` for clearer type inference

### 2. Line 804: Initializer for conditional binding must have Optional type, not 'String'
**Issue**: Incorrect optional binding syntax in computed properties
**Fix**: Rewrote closures with explicit parameter names for clarity

### 3. Lines 873 & 891: Cannot use explicit 'return' statement in ViewBuilder
**Issue**: Explicit `return` statements in SwiftUI Preview ViewBuilder contexts
**Fix**: Removed explicit `return` statements from Preview blocks

## Additional Improvements:
- Clarified closure syntax throughout the file
- Improved type inference with explicit parameter names
- Fixed switch statement formatting for better readability
- Ensured all color constants are properly referenced

All compilation errors should now be resolved while maintaining the full interactive logbook functionality.
