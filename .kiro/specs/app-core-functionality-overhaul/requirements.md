# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the systematic overhaul of core functionality in a health and fitness iOS application built with SwiftUI and SwiftData. The primary focus is on implementing robust data persistence with automatic saving capabilities across four key areas: Weight Tracker CSV import/export, auto-saving Journal with tag interactions, a completely rebuilt Supplements tracker, and populating the Exercise Library with seed data. The goal is to provide users with a seamless experience where their data is automatically persisted and restored without manual save actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Weight Tracker CSV Functionality

**User Story:** As a user tracking my weight, I want to export my weight data to CSV format and import weight data from CSV files, so that I can backup my data and migrate from other tracking apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the weight tracker THEN the system SHALL provide an export option that generates a CSV file with date,weight format
2. WHEN the user initiates CSV export THEN the system SHALL query all WeightEntry objects from SwiftData and present a share sheet for saving the .csv file
3. WHEN the user selects CSV import THEN the system SHALL present a DocumentPicker to allow file selection
4. WHEN a valid CSV file is selected THEN the system SHALL parse the file, create WeightEntry objects for valid rows, and save them to SwiftData
5. WHEN importing CSV data THEN the system SHALL avoid creating duplicate entries for existing dates
6. IF the CSV file contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 2: Auto-Saving Journal with Tag Interactions

**User Story:** As a user maintaining a daily journal, I want my tag selections to be automatically saved when I tap them, so that I don't lose my entries when switching between dates or closing the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps a journal tag THEN the system SHALL immediately toggle the visual state and persist the change to SwiftData
2. WHEN persisting tag changes THEN the system SHALL find or create a DailyJournal object for the selected date
3. WHEN the user navigates to a different date THEN the system SHALL query SwiftData and restore the saved tag states for that date
4. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL display the previously saved tag states for the current selected date
5. WHEN no journal entry exists for a date THEN the system SHALL display all tags in their unselected state
6. WHEN a DailyJournal object doesn't exist for a date with tag changes THEN the system SHALL create a new DailyJournal object and save it

### Requirement 3: Rebuilt Supplements Tracker with Auto-Save

**User Story:** As a user tracking supplement intake, I want to mark supplements as taken for specific dates with automatic saving, so that I can maintain consistent supplementation habits without losing my tracking data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first launches THEN the system SHALL seed the supplement store with predefined morning and evening supplement stacks
2. WHEN the user views the supplements tracker THEN the system SHALL display morning and evening sections with their respective supplements
3. WHEN the user taps a supplement checkbox THEN the system SHALL immediately toggle the state and persist it to SwiftData
4. WHEN persisting supplement logs THEN the system SHALL find or create a SupplementLog object for the supplement and selected date
5. WHEN the user changes dates THEN the system SHALL query and display the saved supplement states for that date
6. WHEN the user navigates away and returns THEN the system SHALL restore the previously saved supplement states
7. WHEN no supplement log exists for a date THEN the system SHALL display all supplements as not taken

### Requirement 4: Exercise Library Population

**User Story:** As a user planning workouts, I want access to a pre-populated exercise library organized by muscle groups, so that I can quickly find and select exercises for my workout routines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first launches THEN the system SHALL check if the exercise library is empty and populate it with seed data
2. WHEN seeding exercises THEN the system SHALL create ExerciseDefinition objects for chest, back, legs, shoulders, and arms categories
3. WHEN the exercise library is accessed THEN the system SHALL display all seeded exercises organized by muscle groups
4. WHEN exercises already exist in the library THEN the system SHALL NOT duplicate the seed data
5. IF the seeding process fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and allow manual exercise addition

### Requirement 5: Data Model Integrity

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want my data to be consistently structured and reliably stored, so that all features work seamlessly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating SwiftData models THEN the system SHALL ensure proper relationships and data types
2. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL initialize all required SwiftData models and containers
3. WHEN data operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback
4. WHEN migrating between app versions THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and compatibility
5. WHEN multiple views access the same data THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent state across the application

### Requirement 6: User Experience and Performance

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the app, I want smooth, responsive interactions with immediate visual feedback, so that the app feels reliable and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN data is being saved THEN the system SHALL not block the user interface
3. WHEN switching between dates THEN the system SHALL load and display data within 500ms
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL complete initialization and display the main interface within 2 seconds
5. IF network or storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and recovery options
