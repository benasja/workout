# Critical Bug Fixes Summary

## 1. Fixed the "Next Day" Data Handling (The Midnight Bug)

### Problem
After 00:00 (midnight), the app's "Today" screen failed to load, showing an "Unable to load data" error. The Recovery tab would crash. Recovery scores were recalculating throughout the day.

### Root Cause
The app was trying to fetch sleep and recovery data for the current calendar day, which has no data until the user wakes up.

### Solution
- **Modified `getMostRecentDataDate()` in PerformanceView.swift**: Extended the window from 6 AM to 8 AM for fetching previous day's data when viewing "today" after midnight.
- **Made Recovery Scores Static**: Enhanced caching in RecoveryScoreCalculator to ensure scores don't recalculate throughout the day.
- **Added Graceful Fallbacks**: Updated the UI to always show the Daily Readiness Card and Quick Actions, even when data is unavailable.
- **Improved Loading States**: Added loading indicators and placeholder states instead of error screens.

### Key Changes
```swift
// Before: Would crash or show error after midnight
if calendar.isDateInToday(dateModel.selectedDate) && currentHour < 6 {

// After: Graceful handling with extended window
if calendar.isDateInToday(dateModel.selectedDate) && currentHour < 8 {
```

## 2. Fixed the Workout History Calculation

### Problem
Newly completed workouts showed "0m" duration, "0 sets," and "0 kg total" in Workout History, even though the underlying set data was saved correctly.

### Root Cause
The computed properties on WorkoutSession (totalVolume, setCount) weren't being calculated correctly due to incomplete relationship establishment between WorkoutSession, CompletedExercise, and WorkoutSet.

### Solution
- **Fixed Relationship Management**: Ensured all relationships are properly established when adding sets to workouts.
- **Enhanced `addSetToWorkout()` method**: Added proper relationship linking between sets, completed exercises, and workout sessions.
- **Improved `endWorkout()` method**: Added validation to ensure all sets are properly linked to the session.
- **Fixed `logSet()` method**: Ensured sets are added to both the completed exercise and the workout session.

### Key Changes
```swift
// Before: Missing relationship links
set.completedExercise = completedExercise
session.sets.append(set)

// After: Complete relationship establishment
set.completedExercise = completedExercise
set.exercise = exercise
completedExercise.sets.append(set)
if let workoutSession = completedExercise.workoutSession {
    workoutSession.sets.append(set)
}
```

## 3. Fixed the Live Workout UX

### Problem
- Rest timer was unwanted by the user
- Auto-fill logic was populating the second set instead of the first set
- Auto-fill was using calculated e1RM values instead of actual weight/reps

### Root Cause
- Rest timer functionality was built in but not requested
- Auto-fill logic was incorrectly targeting subsequent sets
- Auto-fill was using computed e1RM instead of raw data

### Solution
- **Removed Rest Timer**: Completely removed RestTimerView, rest timer state, and all associated logic.
- **Fixed Auto-Fill Logic**: Modified to populate the FIRST set (Set 1) with previous workout data.
- **Corrected Data Source**: Auto-fill now uses actual weight and reps from previous WorkoutSet objects, not calculated e1RM values.
- **Cleaned Up Code**: Removed unused variables and methods related to rest timer functionality.

### Key Changes
```swift
// Before: Auto-fill on second set with e1RM
if initialInputs.isEmpty { initialInputs.append(("", "", false)) }

// After: Auto-fill on first set with actual data
if initialInputs.isEmpty {
    if let lastSet = previousSets.first {
        initialInputs.append(("\(lastSet.weight)", "\(lastSet.reps)", false))
    } else {
        initialInputs.append(("", "", false))
    }
}
```

## Impact

### Before Fixes
- App would crash or show errors after midnight
- Workout history showed incorrect data (0m, 0 sets, 0 kg)
- Poor workout UX with unwanted rest timer and incorrect auto-fill

### After Fixes
- App works seamlessly 24/7 with graceful fallbacks
- Workout history accurately displays duration, sets, and volume
- Streamlined workout experience with proper auto-fill on first set
- Recovery scores are truly static throughout the day
- UI always remains functional with appropriate loading states

## Files Modified
1. `work/Views/PerformanceView.swift` - Midnight bug fixes and UI improvements
2. `work/RecoveryScoreCalculator.swift` - Static score caching
3. `work/DataManager.swift` - Workout relationship management
4. `work/Views/WorkoutView.swift` - Rest timer removal and auto-fill fixes

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing code patterns and architecture.
