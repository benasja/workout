# DateModel Scope Fix

## Issue
Compilation error in PerformanceView:
```
Cannot find 'dateModel' in scope
```

## Root Cause
The `QuickActionsView` struct was trying to use `dateModel` in the navigation link, but it only had access to `tabSelectionModel` environment object:

```swift
struct QuickActionsView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var tabSelectionModel: TabSelectionModel  // ‚úÖ Available
    // Missing: @EnvironmentObject var dateModel: PerformanceDateModel  // ‚ùå Missing
    
    var body: some View {
        // ...
        NavigationLink(destination: FuelLogDashboardView()
            .environmentObject(dateModel)  // ‚ùå Error: Cannot find 'dateModel' in scope
            .environmentObject(tabSelectionModel)) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution
Added the missing `PerformanceDateModel` environment object to `QuickActionsView`:

**Before:**
```swift
struct QuickActionsView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var tabSelectionModel: TabSelectionModel
```

**After:**
```swift
struct QuickActionsView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var dateModel: PerformanceDateModel
    @EnvironmentObject var tabSelectionModel: TabSelectionModel
```

## Environment Object Flow
```
PerformanceView
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @EnvironmentObject var dateModel: PerformanceDateModel ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @EnvironmentObject var tabSelectionModel: TabSelectionModel ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ QuickActionsView
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @EnvironmentObject var dateModel: PerformanceDateModel ‚úÖ (now added)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @EnvironmentObject var tabSelectionModel: TabSelectionModel ‚úÖ
```

## Why This Works
- `QuickActionsView` is a child view of `PerformanceView`
- Environment objects are inherited by child views
- Both environment objects are now properly declared and accessible
- The navigation link can now pass both objects to `FuelLogDashboardView`

## Files Modified
- `work/Views/PerformanceView.swift`

## Validation Results
- ‚úÖ Compilation error resolved
- ‚úÖ `dateModel` now in scope for `QuickActionsView`
- ‚úÖ All syntax validation checks pass
- ‚úÖ Environment objects properly accessible

## Status
üéâ **DateModel scope issue fixed successfully**
The nutrition quick action can now properly access and pass the `dateModel` environment object.
